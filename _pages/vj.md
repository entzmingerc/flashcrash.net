# How to Run Flash Crash

## Preparation

*Sign Up Sheet & Marketing*

*Discord Admin & Invites*

*Live Performances vs Pre-recorded*

- Create a document showing who is playing live versus who is recording.
- Be prepared to change this regularly. People often change their minds as they either get more comfortable with streaming live or their plans change and have to send in a video.
- Set a deadline for when videos need to be in. 24 hours before go live is recommended.
- Offer tech support and help with streaming.
- Pay extra attention to *not letting the audience know* who is live versus who is pre-recorded. So far I don't think we've had a single mixup where the VLC interface goes out on stream, etc. It's a fun minigame to play as the VJ.

*Twitch & OBS*

- Talk to previous VJs about acquiring the Twitch stream keys.
- SLOBS and OBS have both been used successfully. Other tools are probably fine too.

*Assets*

- Assets for the stream may or may not match the branding of the flier. It all depends on the vibe.
- DISABLE ALL SOUND EFFECTS!!!
- Minimally there should be a some type of "FLASH CRASH" branded overlay visibile at all times. Lower left hand corner during performances has been the norm.
- DISABLE ALL SOUND EFFECTS!!!
- Between sets there should be some type of "lobby" that shows chat. This is so that people watching the VODs in the future can see audience interacation.
- DISABLE ALL SOUND EFFECTS!!!
- Keep it simple.
- We don't give a shit about subs or donations. Don't fly banners that say "SO AND SO SUBBED" or "SO AND SO DONATED."
- DISABLE ALL SOUND EFFECTS!!!
- Did I mention you need to disable all sound effects? This extends beyond SLOBS/OBS all the way to your operating system. The last thing anyone wants is a little ding from your antivirus when someone is performing.
- A countdown timer to the next performance is nice, but not required.
- Have a "greatest hits" video or two ready to go in case someone bails last minute.
- Have a text area ready to make announcements.

## Pre Show
---

*Doors*

- Start streaming approximately 30 minutes before the show.
- Have interstitial DMCA free music playing so that we may upload VODs without getting flagged.
- Use the chat to communicate with the crowd.

*The First Performance*

- Keep a tight ship when it comes to timeslots. This is a global event and some folks stay up late / get up early to catch certain performances. In dire situations, move the whole schedule back by half hour increments so that everything can still start and end at the top and bottom of the hour.
- Use Discord to coordinate with live performers.
- It is helpful to have a secondary "monitoring" computer/device to check the live stream and preview performers streams.

## Mid Show
---

*Intermission*

- Run an intermission in the middle of the show. This can simply be the "lobby" scene or could be something fun like a video.
- Take a break yourself during the intermission! Eat. Drink. Be merry.

## Post Show
---

*Recursive Sign Up*

- At the end of each Flash Crash we always announce the next Flash Crash. Share the signup sheet URL on stream somehow and let poeple konw signups are open.

*After Party*

- Throw a video chat link (Zoom, Discord, etc.) up at the end of the stream and invite folks to the after party!

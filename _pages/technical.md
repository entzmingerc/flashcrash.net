# PERFORMING

Performing a has a few requirements:

1. Make music with code! Flash Crash is a showcase for livecoding.
2. Show us your screen! We want to see your code while you play.
3. Get weird! Experiments and crashes are celebrated. This is an opportunity to showcase radically wild work.

# LIVE SETS

We use [https://vdo.ninja](https://vdo.ninja) to send everyone's captures to the VJs. We assume you are familiar with OBS or similar. If not, ask the organizers for a (flash) crash course.

It is just a few steps:

1. Go to [https://vdo.ninja/](https://vdo.ninja/)
2. Click on "Add Your Camera to OBS."
3. Configure your audio and video sources. If you have a scene set up in OBS that you want to use, you can start the "Virtual Camera" in OBS and use that as your video source. You can hop in any time to make sure your set up works - you should see yourself and hear your own audio in the browser.
3. Once that is working, you'll see your stream URL at the top of the page. Share this with the VJs in the #stream-coordination channel in Discord. It will look something like this: `https://vdo.ninja/?view=UmjMeRx`
4. The VJs will take your VDO Ninja stream and pipe you into the [https://twitch.tv/lines_community](https://twitch.tv/lines_community) for your set.
5. You shred.
6. The end!

# RECORDED SETS

If you're planning to pre-record your set, please share it with the VJs at least 12 hours before curtain call. Whatever format is cool but we would love MP4s.

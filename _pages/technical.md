# LIVE STREAMS

We use [https://obs.ninja](https://obs.ninja) to send everyone's captures to the VJs.

It is just a few steps:

1. Go to [https://obs.ninja/](https://obs.ninja/)
2. Click on "Add Your Camera to OBS."
3. Configure your audio and video sources. If you have a scene set up in OBS that you want to use, you can start the "Virtual Camera" in OBS and use that as your video source. You can hop in any time to make sure your set up works - you should see yourself and hear your own audio in the browser.
3. Once that is working, you'll see your stream URL at the top of the page. Share this with the VJs in the #stream-coordination channel in Discord. It will look something like this `https://obs.ninja/?view=UmjMeRx`.
4. The VJs will take your OBS Ninja stream and pipe you into the [https://twitch.tv/lines_community](https://twitch.tv/lines_community) for your set.
5. You shred.
6. The end!

# RECORDED

If you're planning to pre-record your set, please share it with the VJs at least 12 hours before curtain call. Whatever format is cool but we would love MP4s.

# FLASH CRASH IS A CELEBRATION OF LIVECODING

We are...

- ...root(-kit)ed in the global livecoding scene.
- ...anchored by the rallying cry "show us your screens!"
- ...a recursive live stream && artist community.
- ...celebrating crashes && mistakes.
- ...everywhere && everywhen.
- ...everycolor && everygender.
- ...inventing && destroying microgenres daily.
- ...pushing the boundaries of music && technology.
- ...never ending && already over.
- ...[inviting you.](https://llllllll.co/t/45273)

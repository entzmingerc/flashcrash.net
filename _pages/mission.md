# To be changed by the world.

We are...

- ... here to be changed by the world.
- ... here to be changed by each other.
- ... here to change each other.
- ... a celebration of livecoding.
- ... root(-kit)ed in the global livecoding scene.
- ... anchored by the rallying cry "show us your screens!"
- ... a recursive live stream && artist community.
- ... celebrating crashes && mistakes.
- ... everywhere && everywhen.
- ... everycolor && everygender.
- ... inventing && destroying microgenres daily.
- ... pushing the boundaries of music && technology.
- ... never ending && already over.
- ... [inviting you.](https://llllllll.co/t/45273)
